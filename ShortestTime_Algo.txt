    // take and divide it by the distance.
    
    // NOTE: I can see this app using machine learning to record the users walk 
    // time at the end, so that it can predict and change the users estimated time.

    // If it is by bike, we must divide the distance by the average speed of a bike.

    // If it is by car we divide by the average car speed around here, 25 m/h.
